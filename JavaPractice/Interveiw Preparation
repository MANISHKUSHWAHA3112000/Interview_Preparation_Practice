### Question 1: Can you briefly introduce yourself and highlight your key strengths?  
-->. Hi, my name is Manish Kushwaha. I am a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of experience in building scalable web applications using Java,
 Spring Boot, and Angular. At Capgemini, I developed REST APIs integrating multiple systems, optimized PostgreSQL queries to reduce latency,
and created responsive Angular screens that improved efficiency for shipment tracking and cargo operations. I also streamlined CI/CD workflows with Docker and Kubernetes,
cutting deployment time by 40%. My key strengths are problem-solving, attention to detail, and delivering high-quality solutions under tight deadlines. 
Additionally, I hold certifications in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure (AZ-204), which strengthen my cloud and DevOps knowledge.
     

Cross-Questions & Answers (Directly After Introduction)
Interviewer: You mentioned scalability — can you share a situation where scalability was a challenge and how you solved it?
Answer: In the shipment tracking project, we had performance issues when handling large cargo updates. I optimized PostgreSQL queries by adding proper indexing and restructuring joins, which reduced update latency by 25% and improved scalability for 10K+ records processed daily.

-- Optimized query for shipment tracking with cargo updates
SELECT cu.cargo_id, cu.status, cu.update_date, s.shipment_name
FROM cargo_updates cu
JOIN shipments s ON cu.shipment_id = s.id
WHERE cu.update_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY cu.update_date DESC;


Interviewer: How did you streamline CI/CD workflows with Docker and Kubernetes?
Answer: Initially, deployments were manual and time-consuming. I containerized services with Docker, set up Kubernetes for orchestration, and integrated GitHub Actions for automation. This reduced deployment time by 40% and enabled zero-downtime releases.


# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
      - name: Push to Registry
        run: docker push myregistry/myapp:latest
      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml


Interviewer: You highlighted improving page load speed by 35% — what techniques did you use?
Answer: I implemented Angular’s lazy loading for modules, optimized bundle sizes, and used modular rendering. I measured improvements with Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse, which showed a 35% faster load time.

// app-routing.module.ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'dashboard', loadChildren: () => import('./dashboard/dashboard.module').then(m => m.DashboardModule) },
  { path: 'reports', loadChildren: () => import('./reports/reports.module').then(m => m.ReportsModule) }
];


Interviewer: How have your Azure certifications helped in real projects?
Answer: My AZ-900 and AZ-204 certifications gave me a strong foundation in cloud services. I applied this knowledge when integrating Azure Event Grid and Service Bus, ensuring real-time communication with 99.9% uptime.

// Example: Publishing event to Azure Event Grid
EventGridPublisherClient client = new EventGridPublisherClient(
    new Uri("https://<topic-name>.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events"),
    new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>")
);

await client.SendEventAsync(new EventGridEvent(
    subject: "CargoUpdate",
    eventType: "Cargo.StatusChanged",
    dataVersion: "1.0",
    data: new { CargoId = 123, Status = "Delivered" }
));


Interviewer: Can you share an example of a critical issue you solved under tight deadlines?
Answer: During cargo operations, microservices communication was delayed. I analyzed logs, identified bottlenecks, and integrated Azure Service Bus. This resolved the issue quickly and ensured smooth operations before the release deadline.

// Using Azure Service Bus for reliable messaging
@Service
public class CargoMessageService {
    @Autowired
    private ServiceBusSenderClient senderClient;

    public void sendCargoUpdate(String cargoId, String status) {
        ServiceBusMessage message = new ServiceBusMessage(cargoId + ":" + status);
        senderClient.sendMessage(message);
    }
}


Interviewer: What was your biggest contribution in the shipment tracking project?
Answer: My biggest contribution was developing 10+ Angular screens and REST APIs that integrated 5+ systems. This allowed seamless tracking for 500+ users daily and improved operational efficiency significantly.

// Example REST API for shipment tracking
@GetMapping("/shipments/{id}")
public Shipment getShipment(@PathVariable Long id) {
    return shipmentRepository.findById(id)
        .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Shipment not found"));
}


Interviewer: You mentioned role-based access — how did you design it effectively?
Answer: I implemented role-based access using Spring Security, defining 5+ user roles across 3 modules. This ensured secure access control while maintaining flexibility for admins, operators, and customers.

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .antMatchers("/operator/**").hasRole("OPERATOR")
        .antMatchers("/customer/**").hasRole("CUSTOMER")
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and().formLogin();
}

------------------------------------------ Java Interview question  -----------------------------------------------------------------

Question. - How the java internally works?
Java internally works by compiling source code into bytecode, which the JVM loads, verifies, and executes using an interpreter and 
Just-In-Time compiler, while managing memory through garbage collection.

Question - What is Java ?
Java is a High Level object oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystem in 1995. I t is used for developing the desktop application,web application,android apps and enterprise system.

Question - What is the feature of Java ?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java supports OOP concepts to create modular and reusable code.
Platform Independence: Java programs can run on any operating system with a JVM.
Robust and Secure: Java ensures reliability and security through strong memory management and exception handling.
Multithreading and Concurrency: Java allows concurrent execution of multiple tasks for efficiency.
Rich API and Standard Libraries: Java provides extensive built-in libraries for various programming needs.
Frameworks for Enterprise and Web Development: Java supports frameworks that simplify enterprise and web application development.
Open-Source Libraries: Java has a wide range of libraries to extend functionality and speed up development.
Maintainability and Scalability: Java’s structured design allows easy maintenance and growth of applications.

Question - How the Java program run and executed ?
Java  Compiler " javac " compiles it into bytecode "fileName.class".Then JVM reads the .class file and interprets the Bytecode,
JVM convert bytecode to machine readable code ie "binary (000101010) and then executed the program.



       HelloWorld.java  ---->  Java compiler -----> HelloWorld.class 
                                                          |
