### Question 1: Can you briefly introduce yourself and highlight your key strengths?  
-->. Hi, my name is Manish Kushwaha. I am a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of experience in building scalable web applications using Java,
 Spring Boot, and Angular. At Capgemini, I developed REST APIs integrating multiple systems, optimized PostgreSQL queries to reduce latency,
and created responsive Angular screens that improved efficiency for shipment tracking and cargo operations. I also streamlined CI/CD workflows with Docker and Kubernetes,
cutting deployment time by 40%. My key strengths are problem-solving, attention to detail, and delivering high-quality solutions under tight deadlines. 
Additionally, I hold certifications in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure (AZ-204), which strengthen my cloud and DevOps knowledge.
     

Cross-Questions & Answers (Directly After Introduction)
Interviewer: You mentioned scalability — can you share a situation where scalability was a challenge and how you solved it?
Answer: In the shipment tracking project, we had performance issues when handling large cargo updates. I optimized PostgreSQL queries by adding proper indexing and restructuring joins, which reduced update latency by 25% and improved scalability for 10K+ records processed daily.

Interviewer: How did you streamline CI/CD workflows with Docker and Kubernetes?
Answer: Initially, deployments were manual and time-consuming. I containerized services with Docker, set up Kubernetes for orchestration, and integrated GitHub Actions for automation. This reduced deployment time by 40% and enabled zero-downtime releases.

Interviewer: You highlighted improving page load speed by 35% — what techniques did you use?
Answer: I implemented Angular’s lazy loading for modules, optimized bundle sizes, and used modular rendering. I measured improvements with Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse, which showed a 35% faster load time.

Interviewer: How have your Azure certifications helped in real projects?
Answer: My AZ-900 and AZ-204 certifications gave me a strong foundation in cloud services. I applied this knowledge when integrating Azure Event Grid and Service Bus, ensuring real-time communication with 99.9% uptime.

Interviewer: Can you share an example of a critical issue you solved under tight deadlines?
Answer: During cargo operations, microservices communication was delayed. I analyzed logs, identified bottlenecks, and integrated Azure Service Bus. This resolved the issue quickly and ensured smooth operations before the release deadline.

Interviewer: What was your biggest contribution in the shipment tracking project?
Answer: My biggest contribution was developing 10+ Angular screens and REST APIs that integrated 5+ systems. This allowed seamless tracking for 500+ users daily and improved operational efficiency significantly.

Interviewer: You mentioned role-based access — how did you design it effectively?
Answer: I implemented role-based access using Spring Security, defining 5+ user roles across 3 modules. This ensured secure access control while maintaining flexibility for admins, operators, and customers.
