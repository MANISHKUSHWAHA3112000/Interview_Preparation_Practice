Every day I wake up at 7:00 AM and start my morning by taking the overnight oats from the fridge. 
Then I go to the ground floor to boil fourteen eggs while I iron my clothes. By 7:30 AM, both tasks are finished, and 
I freshen up by brushing my teeth and taking a bath. After bathing, I drink a glass of warm water, and five minutes later I eat my breakfast, 
which consists of overnight oats with banana, one whole egg, and one egg white. At 8:30 AM, I leave my PG and reach the office by 9:00 AM, 
where I begin my day with a cup of cappuccino. From 9:00 to 11:00 AM, I practice coding in Java, and between 11:00 and 1:30 PM, 
I study backend development with Java and frontend development with Angular while having my mid-morning snack of 100 grams of roasted chana. 
At 1:30 PM, I start working on my project, which usually continues until 2:30 or 3:00 PM depending on meetings and workload. At 3:00 PM, 
I have lunch, which includes two whole eggs, one egg white, and 100 grams of cooked rice. After lunch, I continue project work until 4:30 PM, 
when I leave the office and return to my PG in about twenty minutes.In the evening, I go to the gym from 5:00 to 7:00 PM. After my workout, 
I spend another hour working on my project until 8:00 PM. Dinner is at 8:00 PM, and on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 
I eat five whole eggs along with one roti, 100 grams of rice, and a cup of dal. After dinner, I take a walk from 8:30 to 9:30 PM to help with digestion. 
From 9:30 to 10:30 PM, I continue working on my project, and then I spend some time learning English between 10:30 and 11:30 PM, 
depending on my workload. Finally, I go to bed around 11:00 or 11:30 PM to rest for the next day.
